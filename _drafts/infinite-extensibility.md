Tech reporter Farhad Manjoo laid out a terrifying bellwether in a recent column in the New York Times. Gadgets, and their attendant audiences, are supposedly dead:

> Winter is coming for gadgets. Everywhere you look, these days, gadgets seem on the rocks. Pebble, which makes smartwatches, has been purchased by Fitbit, which has had its own problems. GoPro may be going bust, while Jawbone, Nest and other members of the gentry of gadget pageantry look just about ready to stick a fork into.

You can place a bit of the blame in shifting consumer interests — the demand for apps and toys exists only insofar as they can get simple tasks done well.

In the realm of software development, I've been noticing a wide-scale shift from minimalism to a thing which we'll call the infinitely extensible product. Chrome has its extensions, Atom and Sublime have their packages, even bash has its [reskin](https://hyper.is) with, yes, its own CLI extension manager — these tools all have their primary uses, but have potential to unfold infinitesimally, as your needs get more and more specific.

The shift toward extensibility — shorthand for modularity and duality of purpose at this point — is rearing its face in consumer gadgets, too. Farhad Manjoo's most [recent column](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/technology/personaltech/the-gadget-apocalypse-is-upon-us.html) on the end of gadgets reveals the danger in trying to make it a one-trick pony in the tech world: you're bound to be bought out, or be swept out by a generic competitor.

The trick is, then, to stop building simple tools. Though Apple gets flak for cultivating a walled garden, I see plenty of fart apps and two-day IAP pap littered in with the real apps.

And for the most part, people have stopped side-to-side Apple and Android apps — we've hit the point where our phones are performing **remarkably** simple tasks with little real difference between apps/ecosystems. We're more likely to settle on the first thing that can get the job done well. Farhad writes:

> I’m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.

So there you have it. Stop iterating on current feature sets. Make sure your product transcends them in some way.
