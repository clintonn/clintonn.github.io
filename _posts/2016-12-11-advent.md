In the realm of software development, I've been noticing a wide-scale shift from minimalism to a thing which we'll call the infinitely extensible app. Chrome has its extensions, Atom and Sublime have their packages, even bash has its [reskin](https://hyper.is) with, yes, its own CLI extension manager.

All this signals that we're done with simple tools for simple tasks. No one would begrudge a handyman his blunt hammer. But when you can screw the head off and make it an axe or a croquet mallet or a trowel, who wants /just/ the hammer?

The shift toward extensibility — shorthand for modularity and duality of purpose at this point — is rearing its face in consumer gadgets, too. Farhad Manjoo's most [recent column](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/technology/personaltech/the-gadget-apocalypse-is-upon-us.html) on the end of gadgets reveals the danger in trying to make it a one-trick pony in the tech world: you're bound to be bought out, or be swept out by a generic competitor.

The trick is, then, to stop building simple tools. Though Apple gets flak for cultivating a walled garden, I see plenty of fart apps and two-day IAP pap littered in with the real apps.

And for the most part, people have stopped side-to-side Apple and Android apps — we've hit the point where our phones are performing **remarkably** simple tasks with little real difference between apps/ecosystems. We're more likely to settle on the first thing that can get the job done well. Farhad writes:
